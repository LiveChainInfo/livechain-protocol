## 🧠 What Problem Does LiveChain Solve?

Current AI and software systems can make decisions, take actions, and evolve — but they have **no native memory** of why they did what they did.  
LiveChain creates a **verifiable memory layer** for digital events, designed for the age of autonomous compute.

## 🔐 Differentiation from Traditional Blockchains

- Most blockchains track **transactions** — LiveChain tracks **instantiations and behavior**
- Where blockchains ensure **ownership**, LiveChain ensures **intent, authorship, and lineage**
- LiveChain is a protocol for **truth**, not just value

## 🛠️ Architecture Snapshot

- Self-regulating metadata engine
- Blockchain anchoring
- Modular graph of event lineage
- Optional governance layer

## 🌍 Use Cases

- AI model behavior logs
- Agent-based systems (e.g. smart agents or LLMs)
- Code provenance and authorship
- Regulatory and audit trails for autonomous decisions

## ⛓️ Ethos

> “We remember what matters. We forget what’s noise. And we do so verifiably.”

LiveChain is a public-good layer for digital trust.
