# livechain-protocol
This is not just a protocol. It’s a philosophy of digital integrity.
LiveChain is how we remember truth in a world where computation forgets.

> The CDMA Moment: Harmonizing Memory and Multiplicity in Machine Intelligence
> The analog era of AI, like pre-CDMA wireless, was fast but fundamentally untraceable.
> LiveChain is the harmonization protocol — the substrate for memory, meaning, and multiplicity to coexist in digital space.
> Just as CDMA allowed many signals to share the same spectrum without interference,
> LiveChain enables countless AI actions to coexist with verifiable lineage, provenance, and purpose
