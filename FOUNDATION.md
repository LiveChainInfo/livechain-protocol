# LiveChain Foundation

The LiveChain Foundation exists to steward the development and integrity of the LiveChain Protocol — a public-good infrastructure for truth, provenance, and responsible memory in autonomous systems.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To provide open, transparent, and public-benefit stewardship of the LiveChain Protocol, ensuring its continued development in service of digital trust, not private interest.

---

## 🧱 Structure (Proposed)

- **Legal Form**: To be established as a nonprofit or public-benefit corporation (PBC)
- **Jurisdiction**: United States (Delaware or California under evaluation)
- **Initial Founder**: LiveChainInfo (protocol author, domain & repo owner)
- **Initial Repository**: https://github.com/livechaininfo/livechain-protocol

---

## 🔐 Principles

1. **Open Access**: All core protocol components are free to use, modify, and build upon.
2. **Anchored Authorship**: Protocol design is cryptographically time-stamped and traceable.
3. **Governance Transparency**: Major decisions will be visible and open to comment.
4. **Public Good First**: The foundation will resist attempts at enclosure or platform capture.

> LiveChain is for the public, but it starts with one truth: that memory must be intentional, not accidental — and never weaponized.
