# LiveChain Protocol — Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased development of the LiveChain Protocol: a cryptographically anchored, metadata-driven provenance layer for compute.

---

## 🌱 Phase 0: Ideation & Authorship (✅ Completed)
- [x] Publish LiveChain Manifesto
- [x] Anchor authorship hash + timestamp
- [x] Register key domains (livechain.net, etc.)
- [x] Launch GitHub Pages site
- [x] Set up initial GitHub repos and vision docs

---

## 🔧 Phase 1: Protocol Architecture Design (🔄 In Progress)
- [ ] Define core data model (event, instantiation, behavior, intent)
- [ ] Design metadata graph schema
- [ ] Establish criteria for self-regulating memory engine
- [ ] Define anchoring mechanisms (e.g., to Ethereum, Arweave, etc.)
- [ ] Publish VISION.md and architectural overview

---

## 🧪 Phase 2: Prototype & Simulation
- [ ] Build simulated compute layer with LiveChain logging
- [ ] Integrate metadata tagging and storage rules
- [ ] Write to local or testnet chain
- [ ] Visualize provenance graphs
- [ ] Validate hash integrity and querying

---

## 🚀 Phase 3: MVP Deployment
- [ ] Choose blockchain for anchoring
- [ ] Release alpha of LiveChain client
- [ ] Open contributor working groups
- [ ] Publish whitepaper v1
- [ ] Launch community discussion board / DAO-style forum

---

## 🏛️ Phase 4: Governance & Public Benefit
- [ ] Establish LiveChain Foundation (public-benefit organization)
- [ ] Explore public funding or grant support
- [ ] Set up long-term governance framework (multi-sig, DAO, etc.)
- [ ] Support adoption in AI / agent communities

---

## 🌐 Phase 5: Ecosystem Expansion
- [ ] Build SDKs and integrations (Python, JS, Rust)
- [ ] Partner with AI toolchains, agent platforms
- [ ] Develop use cases (authorship, AI traceability, data validation)
- [ ] Host LiveChain community summits or hackathons

---

> This roadmap is flexible by design and will evolve as the ecosystem and community grow.
